*Before diving into the main datasets, it's important to understand what cybersecurity is and why these datasets are crucial for keeping our digital world safe. In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity threats are a serious concern for individuals, businesses, and governments alike. From data breaches to cyber attacks, cybercrime is on the rise. That's why it's essential to have access to reliable and up-to-date cybersecurity datasets that can help us identify and prevent potential threats.*

# Main datasets used in cybersecurity 

The field of cybersecurity covers a broad spectrum of subjects and challenges, and it offers a variety of datasets tailored to specific areas of research and analysis within the cybersecurity domain. Below are some of the primary datasets used in cybersecurity, along with brief descriptions and links (as of my research):

### 1. **DARPA Intrusion Detection Data**:
   The DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation datasets were collected as part of the 1998 and 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluations. These datasets contain a variety of network traffic data for evaluating intrusion detection systems.
   - [1998 DARPA INTRUSION DETECTION EVALUATION DATASET](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets/1998-darpa-intrusion-detection-evaluation-dataset)
   - [1999 DARPA INTRUSION DETECTION EVALUATION DATASET](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets/1999-darpa-intrusion-detection-evaluation-dataset)
   - [2000 DARPA INTRUSION DETECTION SCENARIO SPECIFIC DATASETS](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets/2000-darpa-intrusion-detection-scenario-specific-datasets)

### 2. **KDD Cup 1999**:
   The KDD Cup 1999 dataset is one of the earliest datasets used for intrusion detection research. It contains data from the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation experiment.

   - [Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/galaxyh/kdd-cup-1999-data)

### 3. **NSL-KDD**:
   The NSL-KDD dataset is a modified version of the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset, addressing issues such as redundancy and balance. The new dataset is reduced to the unique values and balanced representation of the different types of the described attacks.

### 4. **CTU-13**:
   The CTU-13 dataset is particularly notable for its comprehensive representation of botnet traffic, allowing researchers to analyze and develop detection methods for botnet-related activities. CTU-13 features traffic data related to a total of 7 distinct botnets, featuring a mix of both real-world botnet and user-simulated traffic in a university-like environment.
