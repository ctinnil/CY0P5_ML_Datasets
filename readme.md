# Main datasets used in Cybersecurity 

Cybersecurity encompasses a wide range of topics and issues, and there are various datasets available for different aspects of cybersecurity research and analysis. Below are some of the main datasets used in cybersecurity, along with brief descriptions and links (as of my research):

### 1. **DARPA Intrusion Detection Data**:
   The DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation datasets were collected as part of the 1998 and 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluations. These datasets contain a variety of network traffic data for evaluating intrusion detection systems.
   - [1998 DARPA INTRUSION DETECTION EVALUATION DATASET](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets/1998-darpa-intrusion-detection-evaluation-dataset)
   - [1999 DARPA INTRUSION DETECTION EVALUATION DATASET](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets/1999-darpa-intrusion-detection-evaluation-dataset)
   - [2000 DARPA INTRUSION DETECTION SCENARIO SPECIFIC DATASETS](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets/2000-darpa-intrusion-detection-scenario-specific-datasets)

### 2. **KDD Cup 1999**:
   The KDD Cup 1999 dataset is one of the earliest datasets used for intrusion detection research. It contains data from the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation experiment.
   - [KDD Cup 1999 Dataset](https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-1999/Data)
   - [Kaggle version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/galaxyh/kdd-cup-1999-data)

### 3. **NSL-KDD**:
   The NSL-KDD dataset is a modified version of the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset, addresing issues such as redundancy and balance. The new dataset is reduced to the uniq values, and balanced representation of the different types of the described attacks.

### 4. **CTU-13**:

### 5. **ISCXIDS2012**:

### 6. **CIC-IDS2017**:
   The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Systems (CICIDS2017) dataset contains network traffic data specific to machine learning for intrusion detection system (IDS) research, describing various attack scenarios, such as DoS, DDoS, and port scanning.

y. **UNSW-NB15**:
   - Description: The UNSW-NB15 dataset is another network intrusion detection dataset containing diverse network traffic data. It includes normal traffic and a wide range of attacks, making it suitable for evaluating intrusion detection systems.

7. **Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015)**:
   - Description: This dataset is used for malware classification tasks. It contains a large collection of files, each labeled as benign or malicious, making it suitable for machine learning-based malware detection.

8. **VirusTotal Dataset**:
   - Description: VirusTotal provides a dataset containing various information about files, URLs, and domains. It's useful for research related to malware analysis and threat intelligence.
