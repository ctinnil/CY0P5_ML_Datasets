README four-hours
-----------

These directories and files provide an initial four hours of training
data for the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation.  The purpose
of these four hours is to provide some initial data to DARPA
researchers to make sure the data can be read correctly and that
sufficient information is provided for the evaluation.  We are
currently generating the first week of data and will deliver that
shortly.  This four hours is not the first four hours of the planned
month of training data. It is similar to data that will be included in
the first-week of training data, but not identical.

Please read all the files in the /doc directory.
