README 1week
------------
Six weeks of training data are being created at
MIT Lincoln Laboratory and provided as part
of the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation. 
The first two weeks should be considered as "alpha"
training data collected as the simulation becomes fully
instantiated and reaches a steady state. This data should
be used for initial training and development of intrusion
detection systems. The final four weeks of training data
will be similar to test data and should be used for final 
training and development of intrusion detection
systems. These four weeks of data will include more types
of background traffic and attack variants than the first 
two weeks of data. These four weeks of data will
also be generated using the same procedures
that will be used with the test data.

The first week of training data starts with a large amount
of background traffic an average of two attacks per day. During
the first and second week, services, attacks,  
and additional traffic types are added until traffic patterns 
reach a final steady state by the
end of the second week. Following the second week, the final
four weeks of training data will remain similar to each other
with regard to attack types and background traffic.
The first two weeks of data are being provided early because this
data is similar to the final four weeks of data, and it
will give contractors experience handling the data 
and a head-start in training their intrusion 
detection systems. 
The six weeks of data will include more than
100 instances of 20 different attack types.


BSM and tcpdump data collection normally begins at 8 AM each
weekday and ends 6 AM on the following day, providing
22 hours of data each day.  These start and stop times are not
exact, but vary from day to day.
Data collected on each day are provided in separate directories.
Data starting on monday through friday is placed in separate 
directories named monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday.
Data was collected continuously on a real network which simulated
more than 1000 virtual hosts and more than 700 virtual users. Auditing and
tcpdump is turned off at 6 AM each morning when all machines are
taken down and re-booted. During this down time, a full backup 
is made for the Solaris host named pascal using ufsdump and preparations
are made for the next day's simulation run.
Auditing and tcpdump is then restarted
at roughly 8 AM each morning. The state of all simulation 
machines including pascal (the Solaris machine being audited) should 
not change substantially during down time and no attacks or attack setups
on these machines are performed during down time.

Pascal dump files created using ufsdump are no longer provided on
the Lincoln web site after week one of training  because 
they consume too much disk space
and because very few participants in the 1998 evaluation are using this
data.  These dump files will be provided on CDROM, 
but only to those participants who explicitly request these CDROM's.
Send requests for pascal ufsdump CDROM's to 
darpa-intrusion-eval-admin@sst.ll.mit.edu.
CDROMS containing tcpdump and BSM data are mailed out roughly a week after
the data is posted to the Lincoln web site.
