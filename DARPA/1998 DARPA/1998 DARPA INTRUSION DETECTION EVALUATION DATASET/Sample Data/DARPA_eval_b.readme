DARPA_eval.readme
-----------------

This directory contains four files:
  - this readme
  - feb98_DARPA_pi_meeting.ps.gz
    a gzipped PostScript file containing the presentation slides from the
    talk given by Richard Lippmann at the February DARPA pi meeting. 
  - DARPA_eval_b.tar.gz
    a gzipped tar file containing all the files for the intrusion
    detection evaluation sample data.  
  - DARPA_eval_new.tar.gz
	a gzipped tar file of the new readmes (the bsm and tcpdump files were
	not changed, but there is a new description/scoring system.)


The DARPA_eval_b tar file will expand into a directory called DARPA_eval_b and contains the following pieces:  

(taken from the README in the DARPA_eval_b directory)

CONFIG/
contains the bsm configuration files and starting scripts from 
the simulation (see the file README.bsm for a description of these files)

README
this document

README.bsm

how we produced praudit output for processing  (there is a bug in praudit)

README.formats
describes what your intrusion detection system must do and 
the format of the ".list" files in this directory

README.tcpdump
describes how the tcpdump data was collected
